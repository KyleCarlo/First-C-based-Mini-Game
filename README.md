# First C-based Mini Game

This is my first C project, which I started during the pandemic in 2021 while I was a first-year Computer Science student at De La Salle University - Manila. I recently rediscovered this project while cleaning my computer and decided to upload it to preserve it as part of my programming journey. ðŸ˜Š

I created this project to enhance my proficiency in programming and chose C language as it is an excellent foundation for Computer Science students. Working on this project allowed me to grasp essential concepts like memory management and gain hands-on experience with pointersâ€”a critical skill for understanding low-level programming.
